# Sample App Auth

This app implements the login system explained in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) by Michael Hartl. Only a subset is recreated here, not the whole machinery. The focus will be on login using sessions and the "remember me" functionality is left out.
