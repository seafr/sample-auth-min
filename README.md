# Sample App Auth

This app implements the login system explained in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) by Michael Hartl. Only a subset is recreated here, not the whole machinery. The focus will be on login using sessions and the "remember me" functionality will be left out.

You will notice that the design of the site is very "different" from that of the sample app in the Rails Tutorial. This is deliberate. The focus here is on functionality rather than the layout.
